ESP32 based board with 4 LED channels used for use with WLED software. This ESP32 board features, the powerful ESP-WROOM-32E module, with integrated WiFi and Bluetooth functionality (BR/EDR/BLE). The ESP32 is a chip designed with TSMC ultra-low power management technology. The proven ESP32-D0WD-V3 chip is located in the core of the developed module. This board has a USB-C interface for download of firmware and 5v power during development. The board is flashed with WLED for immediate control of up to four independent addressable LED strips. The board is compatible with WS2811(5/12v), WS2812(5v), WS2812B(5v), WS2813, WS2815(12v), SK6812(5/12v), USC1903(5/12v), TMS1812(12v), and others 3 pin styles. It also has headers that allow use with conventional WeMos D1 Mini style daughter boards and is therefore pin compatible with most accessories. This board has high current 5 volt drivers for driving long LED control signals. It also has three, 3-pin screw connector for one-wire devices, each with 3.3v power and ground. Specifications:

Size: 84mm x 44mm with 2mm mounting holes.
Processor: ESP32 on ESP32-WROOM-E module with WiFi and BT V4.2.
Power Input: 5-15v @4 amps max via 5.5mm x 2.1mm barrel or 5v via USB-C connector.
On Board Regulation: 5v @2 amps switching regulator, 3.3v @800 milliamps.
LED Outputs: Four connectors each with 5v driven LED data output signals, 5/12V power (voltage is the input voltage on barrel connector), and ground.
Four amp resettable fused power input (for applications requiring more than 4 amps use external power injection to LED strips, for most use cases this is approximately 600 LEDs).
Input/Output: USB 2.0 via USB-C connector using the CP2120N.
Input/Output: Standard WEMOS daughter interface on two 1x8 pin headers.
The board comes with four 4-pin to 3-pin cables.
A 3D printed enclosure is also available (+$5.00).
A power injection relay is available (+$3.00).
A I2S MEMS Microphone is available (+$10.00)
