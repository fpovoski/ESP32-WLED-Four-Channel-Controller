ESP32 Control Board WLED, Part No. FB6261L

* DO NOT ATTEMPT TO POWER 5 VOLT  LEDS FROM USB-C. Supplied LED power (5v-14V) needs to 
be connected barrel connector and needs to match the voltage of the
LEDS (or other device) you are powering..

* Device is flashed with the WLED. To place on 
WiFi network use 2.4G phone to connect to "WLED-AP" and default WLED password. . Once connected to your WiFi network, to access the webpage of
the device browse to http://wledecb.local.  WiFi credentials can aslo be set using the  WLED Web
Flasher https://install.wled.me/

* Follow the WLED instructions for compiling your own image. Custom images are available for dual LED and 
Dallas temperature fan control.as well as sound reactive

* Flash over USB or ethernet. To flash over USB use WLED Web Flasher https://install.wled.me/
with the device powered and connected to your host machine.

* For adding Wemos style boards (i.e., relay) with the case installed  use the long (19mm) provided pins.

* WLED Quick Pin Settings - J4:GPIO13, J5:GPIO14, J6:GPIO25, J7:GPIO32, Relay:GPIO18, Dallas:GPIO27,
   J10.PIN3(SDA): GPIO21, J10.PIN4(SCL): GPIO22
